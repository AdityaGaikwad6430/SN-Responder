# This is  whole installtion processes / commands of packages

#Git installation (If not installed)

 1) sudo apt install git -y
 

 # Git commands

  1) git init                 (Makes three boxes 1. Working area  2. Staging area  3. Local repo )
    # Use this command everytime you work on a project

  { # Most important commands
  
     git remote add origin Github link
     git branch branchname                               (To make a branch)
     git branch                                          (To check your current branch)
     git checkout branchname                             (To switch to the selected branch)
     git checkout -b "branchname"                        (To make and switch on that branch)
     git checkout -d "branchname"                        (To delete the selected branch)        }

  2) git add Filename         (Adds a file to the staging area) OR git add . (. means all the files in the current

  7) git revert                               (Resets commit done by you)
  8) git push origin branchname               (Pushes the code to github repo)
  9) git pull origin main                     (Pulls the github code to your server)



 # You need to generate a PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN to push the code
  1) Go to Github 
  2) Open your profile
  3) Open settings
  4) Open developer settings
  5) Select personal access tokens

	#one you inserted when creating user



# Installation of maven

     It is just like github 

  
  
  # Docker commands

   1) docker build -t Tag:tag number   (To build a docker image from Dockerfile)
